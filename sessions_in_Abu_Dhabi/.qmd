## Randomized Assignment: The Gold Standard

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Core idea**: Randomly select who receives the treatment
- **Result**: Treatment and control groups are statistically identical (in expectation)
- **Advantage**: Differences in outcomes can be attributed to the program
- **Why it works**: Randomization creates a valid counterfactual

## Implementing Randomized Assignment

1. Define population of eligible units
2. Decide on level of randomization (individuals, households, villages)
3. Determine sample size (power calculations)
4. Randomly select units to receive treatment
5. Verify balance between treatment and control groups
6. Implement program and collect data

## HISP Case Study: Randomized Villages

- HISP was implemented as a pilot in 100 villages randomly selected from all rural villages
- 100 additional randomly selected villages serve as controls
- This design ensures that treatment and control villages are statistically identical
- Only households below the poverty line in treatment villages were eligible

## Verifying Balance at Baseline

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Check if treatment and control villages are balanced at baseline
df_elig %>%
  filter(round == 0) %>%
  select(treatment_locality, age_hh, age_sp, educ_hh, educ_sp, 
         female_hh, indigenous, hhsize, dirtfloor, bathroom, 
         land, hospital_distance) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c("treatment_locality")) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  do(tidy(lm_robust(value ~ treatment_locality, data = .))) %>%
  filter(term == "treatment_locality") %>%
  select(name, estimate, std.error, p.value)
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Results show most characteristics are balanced
- Small differences in education of household head and distance to hospital
- With many characteristics, some differences by chance are expected
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

balance_table <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Age household head", "Age spouse", "Education household head", 
               "Distance to hospital", "Female household head", "Indigenous"),
  Difference = c(-0.64, -0.04, 0.16, 2.91, -0.004, 0.009),
  p_value = c(0.091, 0.901, 0.021, 0.010, 0.559, 0.490)
)

kable(balance_table, digits = 3)

## Estimating Program Impact: Simple Comparison of Means

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Compare health expenditures in treatment and control villages at follow-up
out_round1 <- lm_robust(health_expenditures ~ treatment_locality,
                        data = df_elig %>% filter(round == 1),
                        clusters = locality_identifier)
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Results**:
- Treatment effect: -10.14 USD
- Standard error: 0.40
- 95% CI: [-10.93, -9.35]
- Highly statistically significant
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Create data frame with estimated means
estimates <- data.frame(
  Group = c("Control", "Treatment"),
  Mean = c(17.98, 7.84),
  SE = c(0.32, 0.25)
)

# Plot
ggplot(estimates, aes(x = Group, y = Mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Mean - 1.96*SE, ymax = Mean + 1.96*SE), 
                width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Health Expenditures at Follow-up",
       y = "Health Expenditures (USD)") +
  ylim(0, 20) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Using Regression Analysis

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Simple regression
out_simple <- lm_robust(health_expenditures ~ treatment_locality,
                      data = df_elig %>% filter(round == 1),
                      clusters = locality_identifier)

# Multivariate regression with controls
out_controls <- lm_robust(health_expenditures ~ treatment_locality +
                        age_hh + age_sp + educ_hh + educ_sp + 
                        female_hh + indigenous + hhsize + dirtfloor +
                        bathroom + land + hospital_distance,
                      data = df_elig %>% filter(round == 1),
                      clusters = locality_identifier)
```

## Regression Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Create a table with regression results
results_table <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Simple Regression", "With Covariates"),
  Estimate = c(-10.14, -10.01),
  SE = c(0.40, 0.35),
  CI_Lower = c(-10.93, -10.70),
  CI_Upper = c(-9.35, -9.32),
  R_squared = c(0.30, 0.43)
)

kable(results_table, 
      col.names = c("Model", "Estimate", "Std. Error", "CI Lower", "CI Upper", "R²"),
      digits = 2,
      caption = "Impact of HISP on Health Expenditures")
```

- Treatment effect remains stable with addition of control variables
- Controls improve precision (smaller standard errors)
- Adding controls increases R² from 0.30 to 0.43

## Why Covariates Don't Change the Estimate Much

In randomized experiments:

1. Treatment assignment is independent of observed and unobserved characteristics
2. Control variables are uncorrelated with treatment status (in expectation)
3. Including controls may:
   - Increase precision (reduce standard errors)
   - Account for any chance imbalances
   - But should not substantially change the point estimate

## Visualizing the Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Create data for visualization
time_points <- c("Baseline", "Follow-up")
treatment <- c(14.49, 7.84)
control <- c(14.57, 17.98)

data <- data.frame(
  Time = rep(time_points, 2),
  Group = rep(c("Treatment", "Control"), each = 2),
  Value = c(treatment, control)
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Time, y = Value, group = Group, color = Group)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  annotate("bracket", xmin = 2, xmax = 2, y = c(7.84, 17.98), 
           label = "Impact: -10.14", size = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "HISP Impact on Health Expenditures",
       y = "Health Expenditures (USD)") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Control" = "red", "Treatment" = "blue")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

- Similar baseline values confirm balance between groups
- Clear divergence after the program
- Treatment group shows significant reduction in expenditures
- Control group shows slight increase over time

## Strength of the Results

- **Internal validity**: Strong - randomization ensures that the impact is attributable to the program
- **External validity**: Limited to similar contexts
- **Precision**: High - narrow confidence intervals
- **Policy relevance**: Impact exceeds the $10 threshold

## From Analysis to Policy Decision

**Policy question**: Should HISP be scaled up nationally?

**Decision criterion**: Program must reduce health expenditures by at least $10.

**Results from randomized evaluation**:
- Impact: -$10.14 (95% CI: [-$10.93, -$9.35])
- Exceeds threshold of $10 reduction

**Recommendation**: The program should be scaled up nationally.

## Limitations of Randomized Assignment

::: {.column width="50%"}
1. **Ethical concerns**
   - Denying benefits to control group
   - Informed consent issues

2. **Practical challenges**
   - Political constraints
   - Implementation costs
   - Scale vs. pilot differences
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
3. **Technical issues**
   - Spillover effects
   - Hawthorne effects
   - Attrition and non-compliance
   - External validity

4. **Timing**
   - Long-term outcomes
   - Delay in results for urgent policies

## When Randomization Isn't Possible

When randomization is not feasible, we can use quasi-experimental methods:

1. **Instrumental Variables**: Using random encouragement
2. **Regression Discontinuity**: Exploiting eligibility thresholds
3. **Difference-in-Differences**: Comparing changes over time
4. **Matching Methods**: Creating comparable groups

## Key Takeaways

1. Randomization creates comparable treatment and control groups
2. With randomization, differences in outcomes can be attributed to the program
3. Including covariates doesn't substantially change estimates but can improve precision
4. The HISP reduces health expenditures by $10.14, exceeding the threshold
5. Based on the randomized evaluation, HISP should be scaled up nationally
